# glut-js

An interpreter and simulator for GLUT written in Javascript.

## What is this?

This is a web app similar to the
[Brainf**k visualizer](http://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer/).
It will interpret glut programs in a debugging environment, where the user
can view and change the contents of the global table, step through the code
or run with breakpoints, change the current instruction, etc.

## How do you run it?

Right now there isn't much to run. You can run the test suite by running
the command `npm test`. You can build the code using `npm run dev`, and then
opening `index.html` in a web browser.
